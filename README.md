<h3>Feelings The Game Should Elicit in Players</h3><br>
<p>Feelings will depend on the players’ background, age, and gender. But overall, I want to make players feel excited and challenged. Because the win-state is not apparent, the players should be curious as to how they could win. This should be a motivational factor to keep them playing the game.</p>
